               eg. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis backrupted some of the world's largest financial firms like the Lehman Brothers. Economies in many countries slowed down.</div></li>

               eg. COVID-19 caused international travel to plunge by 72% in 2020, the worst year on record for tourism, putting the number of travellers back to levels of 30 years ago</div></li>

               tourist infrastructure require use of large amounts of land, water and power to meet the needs of tourists → places and people around facilities are neglected <br><br>
